This a Linux kernel released by Amazon / Lab126 for Kindle 4th generation Non-touch based on Linux 2.6.31 with improvements by Christian Hoff to enable USB OTG functionality.

Christian's website has been offline for years but his old blog posts about this are [still viewable on archive.org](https://web.archive.org/web/20121018003610/http://www.christian-hoff.com:80/).

The plan is to switch to this as the main fread.ink kernel for 4th generation Kindle devices, pending some stability testing.

The original `README` file for this repository was moved to `README.orig`
